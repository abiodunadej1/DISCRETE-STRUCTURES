First i decided on the programming language to use (C++)
After i went over the prompt and then i started to do what i felt in the moment alligned with the prompt.
My first instinct was to create a program that locks a d unlocks when the user inserts a specific password into it.
i did that and then after my plan was to start making the necessary changes to fit into the recquirements.

1. Create a main() section and that is where all the code will go
2. Started off with printing out the title of my project
3. Next, choose variables and then ascribe fucntions to it.
4. create a function that allows the user to type in lock and unlock codes.
5. print out a statement to prompt the user to type in an unlock code.
6. Use an if statement to determine if the user will bbe let in with the access code or not
7. Write out statements and set conditions to display either or, Will the user have access or not?
8. Start working on more complex stuff and get the program to run more effieciently.
9.
