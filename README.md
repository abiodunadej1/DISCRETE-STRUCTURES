# DISCRETE-STRUCTURES
This is my programming Assignment. 
Initially, when i started this project i had ideas to use python but as i have spent more time writing little codes with c++ i decided to use that instead. 
The first thing i did was to open up the assignment and read up deeply on the intstructions to see what was needed to be done and truthfully, it was very new and different to me. I had not done anything like this before so it was scary and also exciting. 



HOW MY PROGRAM WORKS.
The way program works is that it will prompt the user to type in an unlock code to get into the system and after that, you will either be ket in or locked out. If you're let in, it will ask if you want to proceed to lock the device back and after that it should give you both the minimum number of tries and the maximum. I am not entirely sure i got that, but i tried my best and i end]sured my program still ran through to the end. My lockcode is simply "12345" and the unlockcode is "56798".


WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY AND WITH MORE TIME.
1. Ask for help.
2. If i do get that far, i would work on it mopre and make it more advanced for instance, implement a program that gives the user a certain amount of tries before they are locked out or even just asking the user to type in a name or something. I will continue to learn and work on it. 


PROBLEMS I RAN INTO.
1. My program did not run :- My program decided it was not going to produce outputs so unfortunately it did not run for a while. I then looked closely and saw it was a very easy mistake i had made. 
2. I got stuck and then i had to restart multiple times, Getting it to work initially was easy but making it able to do all that was asked was the realluy hard part. I had to start over multiple times in order to get it to work and i'm not sure i did that in the end. 
3.In the end, i am not sure i did the right thing ask but i tried to make it work.




THINGS I HAVE LEARNT.
1. The importance of pseudocode:- Before now, i never really attempted to work with pseudocode i kind of just did anything that felt right in the moment  
but in the middle of this homework, i learnt the hard way. 

2. Ask for help people are always willing:- As i have realized, i need to bbe more open to asking for help because it is simply not possible for me to always know everything. It is normal to need help and it is also very important to reach out when you need to. 

3. Mistakes are normal:- With programming, it is very easy and normal to make mistakes to help with this take things slowly and always try to do the best you can.
