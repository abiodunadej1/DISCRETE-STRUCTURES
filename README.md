# DISCRETE-STRUCTURES
This is my programming Assignment. 
Initially, when i started this project i had ideas to use python but as i have spent more time writing little codes with c++ i decided to use that instead. 
The first thing i did was to open up the assignment and read up deeply on the intstructions to see what was needed to be done and truthfully, it was very new and different to me. I had not done anything like this before so it was scary and also exciting. 




















THINGS I HAVE LEARNT.
1. The importance of pseudocode:- Before now, i never really attempted to work with pseudocode i kind of just did anything that felt right in the moment  
but in the middle of this homework, i learnt the hard way. 

2.Ask for help people are always willing:- As i have realized, i need to bbe more open to asking for help because it is simply not possible for me to always know everything. It is normal to need help and it is also very important to reach out when you need to. 

3.Mistakes are normal:-
